# Binesh

Binesh is an open-source learning platform designed to make content creation effortless for teachers and learning more engaging for everyone.

The name Binesh comes from Persian (Farsi) and means “Insight”, reflecting the platform’s goal of helping learners deeply understand concepts rather than just memorize information.

Binesh allows educators to create bite-sized lessons with interactive components and quiz exercises across any subject, without friction. The platform includes gamification features—such as points, streaks, and achievements, to motivate learners and encourage consistent progress.

A core goal of this project is to introduce a standardized Markdown-based format for educational content. This makes lessons easy to write, manage, update, and reuse, while also being AI-friendly, enabling structured content generation and future automation.

In short, Binesh aims to:

- Empower teachers with a simple, flexible content creation platform
- Make high-quality learning accessible to anyone
- Establish a clean, standardized Markdown format for educational content that works for both humans and AI
